spike on brand new framework

# Loose bits


Anyone can work on it 
Cross-learning is rapid because it's not as difficult to be proficient.

### #1
> It's not overly-coupled to the stack

* HTML, CSS and (maybe) Javascript are the keys

### #2
> It doesn't deal with implementation

* Punt on dealing with bad SASS practices that slow down implementation
* Fake out the data quickly by hand
* Explore edge-case values easily



### #3




* In Adobe tools, we may "time-box" ourselves to an hour of going down a path that might be "crazy"
* With clothing, we may dilebrately try something we are pretty sure will look rediculous
* When painting

We give ourselves the leeway to iterate and cast unworkable solutions aside



## The required setup
* It should be oriented towards only CSS, HTML and (maybe) Javscript*
* It should load the SAME CSS load path as the site itself**

\**Sometimes, you may only include style-guide specific stuff in the style guide only, but I do not recommend this. You want to minimize suprises on implementation. If you're doing it right, you won't have much thats specific (stuff to render colors, the frame itself, etc).

#### Responsive in a day, and cards in a few hours
This proved really effective. We rebuilt the buttons in an hour. We rebuit these "card" widgets (which had so many minor tweaks coming from all corners of the site) in an hour. We knew what everything did in responsive. We rebuilt the modals. We rebiult everything, one at a time.
