          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>In the last year, I've been on several projects focused on the front-end, and I have developed a fondness for Live Style Guides that isn't what it used to be. In fact, I've used them in two primary ways, and one (hopefully) upcoming way. </p>

<h2>3 new goals of a frontend Style Guide</h2>

<ol>
<li>It is the best place for the design spike</li>
<li>It can drive a site-wide refactor</li>
<li>It could (potentially) aid with regression testing</li>
</ol>
        </section>

        <section>
<h1>The design spike</h1>

<p>“I would often ask Kent [Beck], ‘What is the simplest thing we can program that will convince us we are on the right track?’ Such stepping outside the difficulties at hand often led us to simpler and more compelling solutions. Kent dubbed this a Spike.” <em>Ward Cunningham</em></p>
        </section>

        <section>
<h3>A few key phrases</h3>

<ul>
<li>"the simplest thing"</li>
<li>"stepping outside"</li>
<li>"compelling solutions"</li>
</ul>
        </section>

        <section>
<h3>Example spikes</h3>

<ul>
<li>What if we put in a responsive grid?</li>
<li>What can we do to clean up those modals?</li>
<li>Can we make that slider easier on touch for mobile users?</li>
<li>Yep. I'm gonna take two hours and try a fancy sparkle-effect on the avatars. That's right.</li>
</ul>
        </section>

        <section>
<h4>Get answers now!</h4>

<p>You are sculpting in the medium! Designers and developers instantly see the design in-browser (and where it breaks down).</p>

<ul>
<li>Try in responsive (best win)</li>
<li>Quickly explore edge cases</li>
<li>Discover new awesomeness</li>
<li>Try it on your phone</li>
<li>Handle touch events</li>
</ul>
        </section>

        <section>
<h4>Repsonsive! Responsive! Responsive!</h4>

<p>Special callout. It is soooo much easier to do this in browser. You begin to naturally understand and spot basic expansion behavors. Spend your time working on the really nifty stuff (like that super-awesome primary nav).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
<h2>Required to Spike</h2>

<ol>
<li>Low cost of execution</li>
<li>A few team members willing to help out</li>
</ol>
        </section>

        <section>
<h3>Low cost of execution</h3>

<p>Keep it seriously simple!</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Javascript (optional)</li>
</ul>
        </section>

        <section>
<h4>A note on shared partials</h4>

<p>I've seen some teams attempt to use "shared partials" for the components in their LSG. However, this canniballizes the low cost of execution by:</p>

<ul>
<li>increasing the difficulty of a Spike</li>
<li>requiring more knowledge of the whole stack</li>
<li>coupling the LSG to the site, making it inflexible</li>
</ul>
        </section>

        <section>
<h3>A few team members willing to help out</h3>

<p>The best part, is that any team member can design spike in the LSG, when paired. As long as one of them is capable enough. Also great for knowledge transfer. </p>

<ul>
<li>Developer + Designer</li>
<li>Designer + (code-savvy) Designer</li>
<li>Developer + Product</li>
<li>Prodcut + (code-savvy) Designer</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of they keys to lowering your "acceptance handoff."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
<h1>Drive out a site-wide refactor</h1>

<p>I've been a part of a few large-scale SASS refactors in the last year, and one theme that keeps coming up is the pain felt by being chained to existing code. </p>

<p>On one project, we attempted to refactor an existing SASS codebase that was 5+ years old. The experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>A massive amount of tiny regressions we had to chase down.</li>
<li>Reading and pulling apart the spaghetti SASS took FOREVER</li>
<li>A Rube Goldberg file structure ensued, with old and new intermingled and interconnected</li>
</ul>

        </section>

        <section>
<h2>One method</h2>

<p>After speaking with Nicole Sullivan (@nicolesullivan), I came to understand that trying to untangle the mess was taking waaaaayyyy longer than to just re-create the SASS from scratch. We basically Spiked the refactored pieces directly into the Live Style Guide itself.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
<h3>The clean spot</h3>

<p>In order to Spike the new frontend, we needed a place to work. </p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new base CSS file that loads the other new ones</li>
<li>Don't include ANY of the old stuff (except maybe variables files with colors)</li>
<li>Load this instead of the old one your Live Style Gude (or possibly a second page of it)</li>
<li>Build all the new things</li>
</ol>
        </section>

        <section>
<h4>A quick SASS primer</h4>

<p>To understand what makes it clean, you need to understand how your CSS makes it to the page. </p>

<ul>
<li>SASS (CSS) styling must work in harmony</li>
<li>You may have many small SASS files, but generally they aggregate into one big one</li>
<li>That big CSS file is then served to the user with the page</li>
</ul>
        </section>

        <section>
<h4>Example: File structure for current app</h4>
        </section>

        <section>
<h3>The map is not the terrain, and the pattern is not the page</h3>

<p>Live Style Guides often only address repeatable patterns (buttons, widgets, tables, links, typography, etc.) Often, they never contain a representative page in full (fake) composition. Well...</p>

        </section>

        <section>
<h4>Style Tile to the rescue!</h4>

<p>A concept pioneered by Samantha Warren (@samanthatoy), the Style Tile is a fantastic way to drive out a site refactor. This is especially useful if you are switching frameworks or grid systems, or introducing responsive for the first time.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
<h5>Example: Style Tile</h5>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h5>To create a Style Tile</h5>

<p>All you need is another route in addition to the Live Style Guide. Developers will gladly help you add another route, as it is likely dependant on proficiency within the web stack architecture. Import your new base CSS file, and begin to create!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h5>Sidenote</h5>

<p>On new projects now, I always end up creating a Style Tile route, in addition to a Live Style Guide route. We (all of us) as designers need to see a design in composition to really understand how well it's going to work. Again, it is extremely useful for responsive exploration.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
<h2>Large SASS refactor cheat-sheet</h2>

<p>The TLDR; checklist!</p>

<ol>
<li>Set up your clean spot load path</li>
<li>Set up your new Live Style Guide route</li>
<li>Set up your new Style Tile route</li>
<li>Pick a candidate page (I like the most-trafficked one)</li>
<li>Spike the page directly into the new Style Tile</li>
<li>Extract the patterns into the Style Guide as you go!</li>
<li>Write stories to implement into site, switching their load paths one-by-one to the new CSS</li>
</ol>

        </section>

        <section>
        <h3>Built your front-end from the ground-up</h3>

<ul>
<li>It takes too much time to untangle unsustainable CSS practices</li>
<li>Refactor your design and throw away patterns you don't need anymore</li>
<li>Instill good practices from the start</li>
</ul>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h2>Common complications</h2>

<p>When you switch the CSS load path to the new clean spot, there are two common big pain points:
1. Shared partials
2. Libraries that generate markup (ex., Simple Form)</p>
        </section>

        <section>
<h3>Shared partials</h3>

<p>Some LSG's grow to use markup partials from the larger codebase. This cancanabalize the speed in which you can work in the LSG. If the aim is to enforce conformity, I will have something goodies on that at the end of this talk...</p>

<p>In order to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) out web codebases, it is a best practice to factor repeated instances of the same widget into the same partial that defines the widget. The downside to this, is that it couples all of the webpages together.</p>

<p>I have tried or seen these attempted solutions:
* Conforming your new CSS to old markup
* Adding new markup classes to the partials, while leaving the old (perhaps leaving the overall structure in place)
* Render "new" companion versions of the partials if in the new load path</p>

<p>My favorite is the third, but we won't cover why here. </p>

        </section>

        <section>
<h3>Libraries</h3>

<p>SimpleForm (Rails) always bites me on this, but you may encounter it with any library that spits out markup. It's just a pain. Extra classes, in addition to the old ones, is the best way to go. You will have to conform to the structure it implies anyway. </p>
        </section>

        <section>

<h1>It could (potentially) aid with visual tests</h1>

<p>Catching visual regressions is sort of a difficult thing to nail down. The world of visual regression testing  is still in the bronze-age. The holy grail we all seek is to break the build when there is a visual regression. However, defining a visual regression is a difficult task.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
<h2>Lots of approaches:</h2>

<p>There are several approaches out there today:
* Image-difference
* Direct assertion
* Linting</p>
        </section>

        <section>

<h3>Image-difference</h3>

<p>These tools compare a "before" and "after" screenshot of select pages, and alert you if the difference is big enough to warrent suspicion. In theory, they are great. However, I've seen a few implementations, and they are generate so many false-positives that it becomes unusable. I think some are having success with them. Some of them are:
* Wraith
* Huxley
* GreenOnion
* Needle
* CSSCritic</p>

<p>A similar technique is frozen DOM comparisons (cssert)</p>

        </section>

        <section>
        <h3>Direct Assertion</h3>

<p>Another approach is to assert directly against parts of the page. The downside to this is that you end up writing one (or more) tests for every line of CSS you write. That is fine, but CSS has lots of rules and if you change things around, odds are there will be lots of changed in the rendered DOM. Some of these tools are:
* Cactus
* Hardy</p>
        </section>

        <section>
<h3>Linting</h3>

<p>CSSLint, started by Nicholas C. Zakas and Nicole Sullivan, is one of the most well-known CSS tools. It does parses your rendered CSS for bad practices and can greatly help you avoid common no-no's. It can also catch serious bugs that you may not know about (like IE9's 4095 selector limit). But it's not really designed to tell you when you have a visual regression on a page.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
<h3>A new approach</h3>

<p>At Pivotal Labs NYC, we have been working on a new approach to testing yor front-end. It looks at the patterns in your Live Style Guide and asserts their structure and style against the other parts of your site. </p>

<p>If there is a regression from the "whitelist" of patterns, it will break the build. </p>

        </section>

        <section>
<h4>If you're interested</h4>

<p>We are looking for any project interested in trying this out and giving us feedback. The project is in it's infancy, and we are trying it out on it's second codebase now. </p>

<p>The repo is at https://github.com/pivotal/style_cop</p>

<p>Please clone it and try it! (Or mention it to someone who wants to try!)</p>

        </section>

        <section>

<h1>So, let's re-define the Live Style Guide</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Live Style Guide isn't a china  your sandbox</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Your place to explore safely</li>
<li>Your place to transfer front-end knowledge quickly</li>
<li>Your place to spike</li>
<li>Your place to fly!</li>
